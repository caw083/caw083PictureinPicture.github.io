### Picture in Picture with JavaScript
This project showcases the implementation of a Picture in Picture feature using JavaScript. The Picture in Picture (PiP) mode allows users to overlay a floating video player on top of other windows or applications, providing a convenient way to multitask while watching videos.

#### Features
* Picture in Picture Mode: Enables users to open a video in a floating window that stays on top of other applications or windows.
* Draggable and Resizable: The PiP window can be easily dragged and resized to suit the user's preference.
* Support for Multiple Video Sources: The project supports various video sources, such as local video files or video streams from URLs.
* Control Options: Users can control the video playback, including play, pause, and volume adjustment, within the PiP window.
* Responsive Design: The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
#### How it Works
1. The JavaScript code listens for user actions to initiate the Picture in Picture mode, such as clicking a button or right-clicking on a video.
1. When triggered, the selected video is opened in a floating PiP window that overlays other applications or windows.
1. The PiP window can be dragged and resized using mouse events.
1. Users can control the video playback, adjust volume, and perform other operations directly from the PiP window.
1. Exiting the Picture in Picture mode can be done by closing the PiP window or clicking a designated button.

#### Technologies Used
